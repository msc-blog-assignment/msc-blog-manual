For my project, I chose to create a blogging website where users can create articles in markdown and other users can comment on their articles. Users can also see each other's blog articles. All code can be found on the Github at the following URL \url{https://github.com/msc-blog-assignment} or in the attached zip files. The default username and password for the website are "username/password".
